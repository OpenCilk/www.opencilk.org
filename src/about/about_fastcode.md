## An open-source community

Fastcode is an open-source community dedicated to advancing software performance engineering (SPE) -- making software run fast or otherwise consume few resources such as time, storage, and energy.

## Focusing on research and education

To help get the community started, Fastcode has an "academic-first" strategy. By capturing the hearts and minds of students learning about parallel computing and software performance engineering, we can help software developers cope with the end of Mooreâ€™s Law.
