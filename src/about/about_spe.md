## A field whose time has come (again)

For over five decades, software developers enjoyed "free" performance gains thanks to Moore's Law. But no more!

Since 2018 (or so), developers have had to "work" for performance gains, which no longer come for free from the chip-makers. Of all the ways to improve application performance -- e.g., hardware architecture, algorithms -- software performance engineering is by far the least inexpensive and most accessible.

## Notable techniques of SPE
- parallelism
- vectorization
- caching
- algorithms
- data structuring
- compiler optimization
- and more.  

## Notable tools of SPE
- high-resolution timers
- performance profilers
- memory analyzers
- scalability analyzers
- race detectors
- and more.

## Theoretical foundations of SPE
- task-parallel scheduling
- work/span analysis
- reuse distance
- cache-oblivious algorithms
- data structures
- and more.
