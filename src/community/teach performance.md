Task-parallel programming is one of the most important strategies for **multicore performance engineering**: developing fast code for applications that run on commodity and cloud multicore computers.  The recent demise of Moore's Law, which ended semiconductor technology's virtual monopoly on growing computing performance, and the importance of performance to many modern applications &mdash; including machine learning, simulation of physical phenomena, and computer security &mdash; has made performance engineering a national strategic priority.  

OpenCilk is well-positioned to help academics teach performance engineering because of its simple language, small codebase, and mathematically provable guarantees of good performance. Materials for teaching are available at [Performance Engineering of Software Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/) &mdash; free and open for you to adapt.
