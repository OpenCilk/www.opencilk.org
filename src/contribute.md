The OpenCilk project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm. A few specific opportunities are listed below. If you see anything interesting, or have ideas that we haven't thought of, please contact us on the [OpenCilk discussion forum](https://github.com/OpenCilk/opencilk-project/discussions). 

## Testing
We are interested in your experiences or issues in installing and writing code and running OpenCilk programs.
We are also interested in collecting performance figures for different computer systems.

## Porting
You can help by porting OpenCilk to other platforms.

## Coding
In addition to developing the OpenCilk codebase, we need your help extending existing code libraries to run in parallel with OpenCilk. Notable opportunities include the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and the [GraphBLAS](https://graphblas.org/) Graph Linear Algebra API.  Also improving the productivity tools.

## Scripting
Writing scripts to automate release testing.

## Documenting
Are you doing something with performance engineering that you want people to hear about? Are you writing how-tos or tutorials to help students with OpenCilk? We would love to hear! Have you prepared a presentation, video, or other educational materials about OpenCilk? Let us know! If youâ€™re unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, [reach out](https://github.com/OpenCilk/opencilk-project/discussions)! 

## Educating
Are you teaching with OpenCilk?  We welcome your contributions in this area.

## Forums
