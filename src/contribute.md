The OpenCilk project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm.

## Writing code
In addition to developing the OpenCilk codebase, we need your help extending existing code libraries to run in parallel with OpenCilk. Notable opportunities include x and y.

## Writing blog posts and other documentation
Are you doing something with performance engineering that you want people to hear about? Are you writing how-tos or tutorials to help students with OpenCilk? We would love to hear! Have you prepared a presentation, video, or other educational material about OpenCilk? Let us know! If youâ€™re unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, reach out! 



Contact us on the [mailing list (TBD)](#) or with [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OpenCilk/opencilk-project/issues).



Our community aspires to treat everyone equally and to value all contributions. We have a [Code of Conduct TBD](#) to foster an open and welcoming environment, and [this guide TBD](#) explains how to contribute to the codebase.
