To help you find the information you need, 
we have organized OpenCilk documention into three categories:

- [Tutorials](/doc/tutorials) that help you learn the fundamentals of OpenCilk,
- A [user's guide](/doc/howto) that shows you how to do important tasks with OpenCilk, and
- A [reference](/doc/reference) that describes the technical design of OpenCilk, both as a language (for application programming) and as an environment (for parallel systems research).

Finally, our [blog](/blog) puts the documentation in context with stories about the latest developments in performance engineering.
