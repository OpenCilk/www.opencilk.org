defn: |-
    Parallel computers&mdash;computers with multiple processing units&mdash;are ubiquitous. Handheld, laptop, desktop, and cloud machines are all
    multicore computers, or simply, multicores, containing multiple processing "cores."  Each processing core is a
    full-fledged processor that can directly access any location in a common shared memory.
