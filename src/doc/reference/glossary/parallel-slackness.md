title: Parallel slackness
defn: |-
    We define the *(parallel) slackness* of a task-parallel computation executed on
    an ideal parallel computer with $P$ processors to be the ratio $(T_1/T_{\infty})/P = T_1/(PT_{\infty})$, 
    which is the factor by which the parallelism of the computation exceeds the number of processors in the machine.
    If the slackness is less than 1, perfect linear speedup is impossible.
