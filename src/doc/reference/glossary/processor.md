A processor implements the logic to
execute program {% defn "instruction", "instructions" %}
sequentially; we use the term "{% defn "core" %}" as a
synonym. This document does not use
the term "processor" to refer to multiple
processing units on the same or multiple
chips, although other documents may
use the term that way
