<h2><a id="hyper.descr">Description</a></h2>
	<p>Cilk <ins>Plus</ins> defines a category of objects called &#x201c;hyperobjects&#x201d;.
		Hyperobjects allow thread-safe access to shared objects by giving each <del>parallel</del>
		strand <ins>running in parallel</ins> a separate instance of the object.</p>
	<p>Parallel code uses a hyperobject by performing a <dfn>hyperobject lookup</dfn> operation.
		The hyperobject lookup returns a reference to an object, called a <dfn>view,</dfn>
		that is guaranteed not to be shared with any other active strands in the program.
		The sequencing of a hyperobject lookup within an expression is not specified. The
		runtime system creates a view when needed, using callback functions provided by
		the hyperobject type. When strands synchronize, the hyperobject views are merged
		into a single view, using another callback function provided by the hyperobject
		type.</p>
	<p>The view of a hyperobject visible to a program may change at any spawn or sync (including
		the implicit spawns and syncs within a <code>_Cilk_for</code> loop). The identity
		(address) of the view does not change within a single strand. The view of a given
		hyperobject visible within a given strand is said to be <dfn>associated</dfn> with
		that view. A hyperobject has the same view before the first spawn within a task
		block as after a sync within the same task block, even though the thread ID may
		not be the same (i.e., hyperobject views are not tied to threads). A hyperobject
		has the same view upon entering and leaving a <code>_Cilk_for</code> loop and within
		the first iteration (at least) of the <code>_Cilk_for</code> loop. A special view
		is associated with a hyperobject when the hyperobject is initially created. This
		special view is called the <dfn>leftmost view</dfn> or <dfn>earliest view</dfn>
		because it is always visible to the leftmost (earliest) descendent in the depth-first,
		left-to-right traversal of the program's spawn tree. The leftmost view is given
		an initial value when the hyperobject is created.</p>
	<p class="note">Programmer note: If two expressions compute the same address for a view,
		then they have not been scheduled in parallel. This property yields one of the simplest
		ways by which a program can observe the runtime behavior of the scheduler.</p>
	<p class="note">Implementation note: An implementation can optimize hyperobject lookups
		by performing them only when a view has (or might have) changed. This optimization
		can be facilitated by attaching implementation-specific attributes to the hyperobject
		creation, lookup, and/or destruction operations.</p>
	<h2><a id="hyper.reduce">Reducers</a></h2>
	<p>The vast majority of hyperobjects belong to a category known as &#x201c;reducers.&#x201d;
		Each reducer type provides a <code>reduce</code> callback operation that merges
		two views in a manner specific to the reducer. For a pair of views <var>V<sub>1</sub></var>
		and <var>V<sub>2</sub></var>, the result of calling <code>reduce(</code><var>V<sub>1</sub></var><code>,</code>
		<var>V<sub>2</sub></var><code>)</code> is notated as <var>V<sub>1</sub>&#x2297;V<sub>2</sub></var>.
		Each reducer also provides an <code>identity</code> callback operation that initializes
		a new view.</p>
	<p>The <code>reduce</code> callback for a &#x201c;classical&#x201d; reducer implements
		an operation &#x2297; such that (<var>a&#x2297;b</var>)&#x2297;<var>c==a</var>&#x2297;(<var>b&#x2297;c</var>)
		(i.e., &#x2297; is associative). The view-initialization callback for such a reducer
		sets the view to an identity value <var>I</var> such that <var>I&#x2297;v==v</var>
		and <var>v&#x2297;I==v</var> for any value <var>v</var> of <var>value_type</var>.
		Given an associative &#x2297; and an identity <var>I</var>, the triplet (<var>value_type</var>,
		&#x2297;, <var>I</var>) describes a mathematical <dfn>monoid</dfn>. For example,
		(<code>int</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>0</code>) is a monoid, as is (<code>list</code>,
		<code>concatenate</code>, <var>empty</var>). If each individual view, <var>R</var>,
		of a classical reducer is modified using only expressions that are equivalent to
		<var>R</var>&#x2190;<var>R</var>&#x2297;<var>v</var> (where <var>v</var> is of <var>
			value_type</var>), then the reducer computes the same value in the parallel
		program as would be computed in the serialization of the program. (In actuality,
		the &#x201c;&#x2297;&#x201d; in the expression &#x201c;<var>R</var>&#x2190;<var>R</var>&#x2297;<var>v</var>&#x201d;
		can represent a set of mutually-associative operations. For example, <code>+=</code>
		and <code>-=</code> are mutually associative.) For example, a spawned function or
		<code>_Cilk_for</code> body can append items onto the view of a list reducer with
		monoid (<code>list</code>, <code>concatenate</code>, <var>empty</var>). At the end
		of the parallel section of code, the reducer's view contains the same list items
		in the same order as would be generated in a serial execution of the same code.</p>
	<p>Given a set of strands entering a sync, <var>S<sub>1</sub>,S<sub>2</sub>,S<sub>3</sub>,&#x2026;S<sub>n</sub></var>,
		associated with views <var>V<sub>1</sub>,V<sub>2</sub>,V<sub>3</sub>,&#x2026;V<sub>n</sub></var>,
		respectively such that <var>S<sub>i</sub></var> is earlier in the serial ordering
		than <var>S<sub>i+1</sub></var>, a single view, <var>W</var>, emerges from the sync
		with value <var>W&#x2190;V<sub>1</sub>&#x2297;V<sub>2</sub>&#x2297;V<sub>3</sub>&#x2297;&#x2026;&#x2297;V<sub>n</sub></var>,
		such that the left-to-right order is maintained but the grouping (associativity)
		of the operations is unspecified. The timing of this &#x201c;reduction&#x201d; is
		unspecified &#x2013; in particular, subsequences typically will be computed asynchronously
		as child tasks complete. Every view except the one emerging from the sync is destroyed
		after the merge. If any of the strands does not have an associated view, then the
		invocation of the <code>reduce</code> callback function can be elided (i.e., the
		missing view is treated as an identity).</p>
	<p>A strand is never associated with more than one view for a given reducer, but multiple
		strands can be associated with the same view if those strands are not scheduled
		in parallel (at run time). Specifically, for a given reducer, the association of
		a strand to a view of the reducer obeys the following rules:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The strand that initializes the reducer is associated with the leftmost view.</li>
		<li>If two strands execute in series (i.e., both strands are part of a larger strand),
			then both are associated with the same view.</li>
		<li>The child strand of a spawn is associated with the same view as the strand that
			entered the spawn.</li>
		<li>If the continuation strand of a spawn is scheduled in parallel with the child, then
			the continuation strand is associated with a new view, initialized using <code>identity</code>.
			The implementation may create the new view at any time up until the first hyperobject
			lookup following the spawn. If the continuation strand does not perform a hyperobject
			lookup, then the implementation is not required to create a view for that strand.</li>
		<li>If the continuation strand of a spawn is not scheduled in parallel with the child
			strand (i.e., the child and the continuation execute in series), then the continuation
			strand is associated with the same view as the child strand.</li>
		<li>The strand that emerges from a sync is associated with the same view as the leftmost
			strand entering the sync.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Even before the final reduction, the leftmost view of a reducer will contain the
		same value as in the serial execution. Other views, however, will contain partial
		values that are different from the serial execution.</p>
	<p>If &#x2297; is not associative or if <code>identity</code> does not yield a true
		identity value then the result of a set of reductions will be non-deterministic
		(i.e., it will vary based on runtime scheduling). Such &#x201c;non-classical&#x201d;
		reducers are nevertheless occasionally useful. Note that, for a classical reducer,
		the &#x2297; operator needs to be associative, but does not need to be commutative.</p>

	<h3><a id="hyper.cpp.syntax">C++ hyperobject syntax</a></h3>
	<del>
		<p class="note">Note: The syntax described here is the syntax used in the Intel products.
			Intel is considering a different syntax for future, either in addition to or instead
			of the syntax described below.</p>
	</del>
	<p>At present, reducers <ins>and holders</ins> are the only kind of hyperobject supported.
		In C++, every reducer <del>hyperobject has a hyperobject type, which</del> <ins>type</ins>
		is an instantiation of the <code>cilk::reducer</code> class template<ins>, which is
			defined in the header <code>&lt;cilk/reducer.h&gt;</code></ins>. The <code>cilk::reducer</code>
		class template has a single template type parameter, <code>Monoid</code>, which
		shall be a class type. <ins>(See <a href="#hyper.cpp.monoid">C++ Monoid class requirements</a>,
			below.)</ins></p>
	<p>For a given monoid, <var>M</var>, the type <code>cilk::reducer&lt;</code><var>M</var><code>&gt;</code>
		defines a hyperobject type. The <code>cilk::reducer</code> class template provides
		<del>constructors, a destructor, and</del> (<code>const</code> and non-<code>const</code>
		versions of) <del><code>value_type&amp; operator()</code></del> <ins><code>operator*()</code></ins>
		and <code><del>value_type&amp; </del>view()</code>, both of which return <del>a</del>
		<ins>an lvalue</ins> reference to the current view<ins>, and <code>operator-&gt;()</code>,
			which returns the address of the current view</ins>.</p>
	<p>A <del>hyperobject</del> <ins>reducer</ins> is created by defining an instance of
		<code>cilk::reducer&lt;</code><var>M</var><code>&gt;</code>:</p>
	<pre>cilk::reducer&lt;<var>M</var>&gt; hv(<var>args</var>);</pre>
	<p>Where <var>args</var> is a list of <var>M</var><code>::<del>value</del><ins>view</ins>_type</code>
		constructor arguments used to initialize the leftmost view of <code>hv</code>. A
		hyperobject lookup is performed by invoking the member function, <code>view()</code>
		or member <code>operator<ins>*</ins>()</code> <ins>or <code>operator-&gt;()</code></ins>
		on the hyperobject, as in the following examples:</p>
	<pre>hv.view().append(elem);
<ins>(*hv).append(elem);</ins>
<ins>hv-&gt;append(elem);</ins><del> hv().append(elem);</del></pre>
	<p>In these examples, <code>append</code> is an operation to be applied to the current
		view of <code>hv</code>, and is presumably consistent with the associative operation
		defined in the monoid, <var>M</var>.</p>
	<p>Modifying a hyperobject view in a way that is not consistent with the associative
		operation in the monoid can lead to subtle bugs. For example, addition is not associative
		with multiplication, so performing a multiplication on the view of a summing reducer
		will almost certainly produce incorrect results. To prevent this kind of error,
		it is <del>common to wrap reducers in proxy classes that expose</del> <ins>possible
			for the monoid to define a separate <code>view_type</code> class that wraps the
			<code>value_type</code> and exposes</ins> only the valid associative operations.
		<ins>(See <a href="#hyper.cpp.monoid">Monoid</a> and <a href="#hyper.cpp.view">View</a>
			class requirements, below.)</ins> All of the reducers included in the standard
		reducer library have such wrappers.</p>
	<h3><ins><a id="hyper.cpp.reducer">C++ <code>reducer</code> class template</a></ins></h3>
	<p><ins>Where the below table indicates that the signature of a function includes the
		form <code>Args&amp;&amp;...</code>, in an implementation that supports C++ variadic
		templates, the function shall be defined as a variadic function template. In an
		implementation that does not support variadic templates, the function shall be defined
		as a set of templates taking from 0 to N arguments of type <code>const Arg &amp;</code>,

	<p>An object of type <var>M</var><code>::value_type</code> is constructed by the <code>
		reducer</code> constructor. This object is called the initial view or leftmost view
		of the hyperobject. When a hyperobject goes out of scope, the destructor is called
		on the leftmost view. It is unspecified whether <var>M</var><code>::allocate</code>
		and <var>M</var><code>::deallocate</code> are called to allocate and deallocate
		the leftmost view (they are not called in the current Intel implementation).</p>
	<p>The implementation may create a view at any spawn that has been scheduled in parallel,
		or may lazily defer creation until the first access within a strand. The implementation
		creates a view by calling <var>M</var><code>::allocate</code> followed by <var>M</var><code>::identity</code>.
		(This is in addition to the initial view created by construction of the hyperobject.)
		The calls to <var>M</var><code>::allocate</code> and <var>M</var><code>::identity</code>
		are part of the strand for the purpose of establishing the absence of a data race.</p>
	<p>At any sync or at the end of any spawned (child) function, the runtime may merge
		two views by calling <var>M</var><code>::reduce(</code><var>left</var><code>,</code>
		<var>right</var><code>)</code>, where <var>right</var> is the earliest remaining
		view that is later than <var>left</var>. The <var>M</var><code>::reduce</code> function
		is expected to store the merged result in the <var>left</var> view. After the merge,
		the runtime destroys the <var>right</var> view by calling <var>M</var><code>::destroy</code>
		followed by <var>M</var><code>::deallocate</code>. Every view except the leftmost
		view is passed exactly once as the second argument to <code>reduce</code>. The calls
		to <var>M</var><code>::reduce</code>, <var>M</var><code>::destroy</code> and <var>M</var><code>::deallocate</code>
		happen after completion of both of the strands that formerly owned the left and
		right views.</p>
	<p>If a monoid member function executes a hyperobject lookup (directly or through a
		function call), the behavior of the program is undefined.</p>
	<p>For purposes of establishing the absence of a data race, a hyperobject view is considered

			<code>&lt;cilk/reducer.h&gt;</code></ins>. C does not have the template capabilities

	<p>The names of these functions are for illustration purposes only and must be chosen,
		as usual, to avoid conflicts with other identifiers. The purposes of these functions
		are as follows:</p>

	<p>The <var>r</var> argument to each of these functions is a pointer to the actual reducer

		library makes this common implementation available as a library function, <code>__cilkrts_hyperobject_noop_destroy</code>.</p>
	<p>A reducer, <code>hv</code>, is defined and given an initial value, <var>init</var>,

	<p>The <var>init</var> expression is used to initialize the leftmost reducer view. The
		<code>CILK_C_DECLARE_REDUCER</code> macro defines a <code>struct</code> and can
		be used in a <code>typedef</code> or <code>extern</code> declaration as well:</p>
	<pre>extern CILK_C_DECLARE_REDUCER(<var>T</var>) hv;</pre>
	<p>The <code>CILK_C_INIT_REDUCER</code> macro expands to a static initializer for a
		hyperobject of any type. After initialization, the leftmost view of the reducer
		is available as <var>hv</var><code>.value</code>.</p>
	<p><del>If</del> <ins>The behavior is undefined if</ins> a reducer <del>is local to
		a function, it shall be</del> <ins>with automatic storage duration is not</ins>
		registered before first use using the <code>CILK_C_REGISTER_REDUCER</code> macro
		and unregistered after its last use using the <code>CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER</code>
		macro:</p>
	<pre>CILK_C_REGISTER_REDUCER(<var>hv</var>);
<em>/* use hv here */</em>
CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER(<var>hv</var>);</pre>
	<p>For the purpose of registration and unregistration, <dfn>first use</dfn> and <dfn>
		last use</dfn> are defined with respect to the serialization of the program. <ins>If</ins>
		the reducer view immediately before unregistration <del>shall be</del> <ins>is not</ins>
		the same (<ins>does not</ins> have the same address) as the reducer view immediately
		after registration, <ins>the behavior is undefined</ins>. In practice, this means
		that any spawns after the registration have been synced before the unregistration
		and that no spawns before the registration have been synced before the unregistration.
		Registration and unregistration are optional for reducers declared in global scope.
		The <code>value</code> member of the reducer continues to be available after unregistration,
		but a hyperobject lookup on an unregistered reducer results in undefined behavior
		unless the reducer is registered again.</p>
	<p>A hyperobject lookup is performed using the <code>REDUCER_VIEW</code> macro:</p>
	<pre>REDUCER_VIEW(<var>hv</var>) += <var>expr</var>;</pre>
	<p>As in the case of a C++ reducer, modifying a reducer other than through the correct
		associative operations can cause bugs. Unfortunately, C does not have sufficient
		abstraction mechanisms to prevent this kind of error. Nevertheless, the Cilk library
		provides wrapper macros to simplify the declaration and initialization, though not
		the safety, of library-provided reducers in C. For example, you can define and initialize
		a summing reducer this way:</p>
	<pre>CILK_C_DECLARE_REDUCER(long) hv =
	REDUCER_OPADD_INIT(long, 0);</pre>
	<p>A C reducer can be declared, defined, and accessed within C++ code, but a C++ reducer
		cannot be used within C code.</p>
	<h3><a id="hyper.c.behave">C hyperobject behavior</a></h3>
	<p>The macro <code>CILK_C_DECLARE_REDUCER(<var>T</var>)</code> defines a <code>struct</code>
		with a data member of type <var>T</var>, named <code>value</code>. The macro <code>CILK_C_INIT_REDUCER(<ins><var>T</var>,</ins><var>I</var>,<var>R</var>,<var>D</var>,<var>V</var>)</code>
		expands to a <var>braced-init-list</var> appropriate for initializing a variable,
		<var>hv</var>, of structure type declared with <code>CILK_C_DECLARE_REDUCER(<var>T</var>)</code>
		such that <var>hv</var>, can be recognized by the runtime system as a C reducer
		with value type <var>T</var>, identity function <var>I</var>, reduction function
		<var>R</var>, destroy function <var>D</var>, and initial value <var>V</var>.</p>
	<p>Invoking <code>CILK_C_REGISTER_REDUCER(<var>hv</var>)</code> makes a call into the
		runtime system that registers <var>hv</var><code>.value</code> as the initial, or
		leftmost, view of the C hyperobject <var>hv</var>. The macro <code>CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER(<var>hv</var>)</code>
		makes a call into the runtime system that removes hyperobject <var>hv</var> from
		the runtime system's internal map. Attempting to access <var>hv</var> after it has
		been unregistered will result in undefined behavior. If a hyperobject is never registered,
		the leftmost view will be associated with the program strand before the very first
		spawn in the program and will follow the leftmost branch of the execution DAG. This
		association is typically useful only for hyperobjects in global scope.</p>
	<p>The implementation may create a view at <del>any spawn</del> <ins>the start of any
		strand</ins> that has been scheduled in parallel, or may lazily defer creation until
		the first access within a strand. The implementation creates a view by allocating
		it with <code>malloc</code>, then calling the identity function specified in the
		reducer initialization. (This is in addition to the initial view created by construction
		of the reducer.) The call to the identity function is part of the strand for the
		purpose of establishing the absence of a data race.</p>
	<p>At any sync or at the end of any spawned (child) function, the runtime may merge
		two views by calling the reduction function (specified in the reducer initialization)
		on the values <var>left</var> and <var>right</var>, where <var>right</var> is the
		earliest remaining view that is later than <var>left</var>. The reduction function
		is expected to store the merged result in the <var>left</var> view. After the merge,
		the runtime destroys the <var>right</var> view by calling the destroy function for
		the hyperobject, then deallocates it using <code>free</code>. Every view except
		the leftmost view is passed exactly once as the second argument the reduction function.
		The calls to reduction and destroy functions happen after completion of both of
		the strands that formerly owned the left and right views.</p>
	<p>If a monoid function executes a hyperobject lookup, the behavior of the program is
		undefined.</p>
	<p>For purposes of establishing the absence of a data race, a hyperobject view is considered
		a distinct object in each parallel strand. A hyperobject lookup is considered a
		read of the hyperobject.</p>
