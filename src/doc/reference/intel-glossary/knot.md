A point at which the end of one {% defn "strand" %}
meets the end of another. If a knot has
one incoming strand and one outgoing
strand, it is a *serial knot*. If it has one
incoming strand and two outgoing
strands, it is a *spawn knot*. If it has
multiple incoming strands and one
outgoing strand, it is a *sync knot*. A
Cilk program does not produce serial
knots or knots with both multiple
incoming and multiple outgoing strands
