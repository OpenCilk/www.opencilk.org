<p>This document defines the OpenCilk extension to C and C++. The
    language extension is supported by a run-time user-mode work-stealing task scheduler
    which is not directly exposed to the application programmer. However, some of the
    semantics of the language and some of the guarantees provided require specific behavior
    of the task scheduler. The programmer visible parts of the language include the
    following constructs:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Three keywords (<code>_Cilk_spawn</code>, <code>_Cilk_sync</code> and <code>_Cilk_for</code>)
        to express tasking</li>
    <li>Hyperobjects, which provide local views to shared objects</li>
</ol>
<p>An implementation of the language may take advantage of all parallelism resources
    available in the hardware. On a typical CPU, these include at least multiple cores
    and vector units. Some of the language constructs, e.g. <code>_Cilk_spawn</code>,
    utilize only core parallelism; some, e.g. SIMD loops, utilize only vector parallelism,
    and some, e.g. SIMD-enabled functions, utilize both. The defined behavior of every
    deterministic Cilk program is the same as the behavior of a similar C or C++ program
    known as the &#x201c;serialization.&#x201d; While execution of a C or C++ program
    may be considered as a linear sequence of statements, execution of a tasking program
    is in general a directed acyclic graph. Parallel control flow may yield a new kind
    of undefined behavior, a &#x201c;data race,&#x201d; whereby parts of the program
    that may execute in parallel access the same memory location in an indeterminate
    order, with at least one of the accesses being a write access. In addition, <del>throwing</del>
    <ins>if</ins> an exception <del>may result in</del> <ins>is thrown,</ins> code <del>
        being</del> <ins>may still be</ins> executed that would not have been executed
    in a serial execution.</p>
<p><ins>The word &#x201c;shall&#x201d; is used in this specification to express a diagnosable
    constraint on a Cilk Plus program.</ins></p>
