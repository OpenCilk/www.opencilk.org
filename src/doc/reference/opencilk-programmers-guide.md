Here is a place where we can add a concise reference guide about how to write a correct program with OpenCilk. (This would be very different than the "language reference" -- which gives "the final word" to "the language police" about what OpenCilk is.)

We might model the reference guide after one or more of these examples:

* GNU C reference manual, for example [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html#Statements) – for C eagles.
* Julia manual, for example [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/) – for Julia eagles.
* Julia developer’s documentation, for example [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/reflection/) – for Julia owls.
* Numpy reference, for example [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.nditer.html#) – for Numpy eagles.
