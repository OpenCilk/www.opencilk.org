## Task-parallel programming

{% defn "parallel algorithms", "Parallel programming" %} involves writing
instructions that can be executed on different processors simultaneously.
Compared to serial programs, whose instructions (logically) execute
one-at-a-time on a single processor, parallel programs can utilize multiple
processing units to reduce the runtime of a computation.  Historically,
parallel programming has been considered substantially more difficult and
error-prone than serial programming.  {% defn "OpenCilk" %} aims to bridge this
gap.  OpenCilk supports the {% defn "Cilk" %} language extensions to C and C++,
which make it easy to write parallel programs that are both correct and fast.

OpenCilk is a {% defn "task-parallel-platforms-programming-and-algorithms",
"task-parallel platform" %} that provides language abstractions for {% defn
"shared-memory" %} parallel computations on {% defn "multicores", "multicore"
%} systems.  As a Cilk programmer, you are only responsible for expressing the
{% defn "logical parallelism" %} in your application, that is, which tasks
*may* run in parallel.  (With Cilk, there are no tasks which *must* run in
parallel.)  The OpenCilk compiler produces optimized parallel code, and the
OpenCilk runtime system schedules and load-balances your computation onto the
available processors in a way that is provably close to optimal.

When using the OpenCilk platform, you write code in the Cilk language, which
extends C and C++ with a just few keywords to support task-parallel
programming.  Specifically, Cilk supports {% defn "fork-join parallelism" %}, a
simple and effective form of task parallelism.  Cilk provides linguistic
mechanisms for {% defn "spawning" %} and {% defn "parallel loops" %}.

In this tutorial, we'll introduce spawning parallel tasks.  Upcoming tutorials
will also cover the following:

- How to use parallel loops.
- How to ensure your program is free of {% defn "determinacy-race", "race bugs"
  %} using the {% defn "Cilksan" %} tool.
- How to determine the {% defn "scalability" %} of your program on multiple
  processors using the {% defn "Cilkscale" %} tool.
- How OpenCilk runs your program to achieve good performance.

## Adding parallelism with `cilk_scope` and `cilk_spawn`

You may think of a task or computation as a piece of code which contains serial
and parallel regions.  A serial region contains no parallelism and its tasks
are executed in sequence, as usual.  A parallel region has two distinguishing
characteristics:

1. Within the parallel region, functions may be {% defn "spawning", "spawned"
   %}, i.e., they may be run in parallel with the caller.
2. At the end of the parallel region, all functions that were spawned within it
   are {% defn "syncing", "synced" %}, i.e., they have finished executing.
   
Functions within either a serial or parallel region may themselves contain
serial and parallel regions, allowing for {% defn "nested parallelism" %}.

You can add parallelism to your program with just two keywords:

- To indicate that a function may be spawned, put the `cilk_spawn` keyword
  before the function call.  The `cilk_spawn` keyword tells the OpenCilk
  runtime system that the function may (but is not required to) run in parallel
  with the caller.
- To delineate a parallel region, use the `cilk_scope` keyword before a [*block
  scope*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/scope).  The OpenCilk
  runtime system will ensure that execution will continue past the `cilk_scope`
  only after all functions that were spawned within it have returned, waiting
  if necessary.

For example, consider the C code below, which shows a parallel implementation
for recursive computation of Fibonacci numbers.  The `cilk_scope` creates a
parallel region spanning lines 6â€“7.  In line 6 the `cilk_spawn` keyword
indicates that `p_fib(n-1)` may be executed at the same time as the rest of the
parallel region (that is, the call to `p_fib(n-2)` in line 7).  The end of the
`cilk_scope` in line 8 guarantees that the spawned function has finished before
the return statement in line 9 is executed.

```cilkc#
int p_fib(int n) {
  if (n < 2)
    return n;                   // base case
  int x, y;
  cilk_scope {                  // begin lexical scope of parallel region
    x = cilk_spawn p_fib(n-1);  // don't wait for function to return
    y = p_fib(n-2);             // may run in parallel with spawned function
  }                             // wait for spawned function if needed
  return x + y;
}
```

A spawned function is called a {% defn "child" %} of the function that spawned
it.  Conversely, the function that executes the `cilk_spawn` statement is known
as the {% defn "parent" %} of the spawned function.  The code in the parent
function that follows a spawn statement in a parallel region is called the
parent {% defn "continuation" %} of the spawn.

Input arguments to a spawned function are passed as they normally would in
serial code and are evaluated _before_ the function is spawned.  That is, the
parent continuation may not start executing until the spawned child arguments
have been evaluated.

{% alert %}

**Note:** Any expression that is or can be converted to a function can be
spawned.  For instance, you can spawn a computation using a function pointer or
member function pointer, as in:

```cilkc
var = cilk_spawn (object.*pointer)(arg1, arg2);
```

{% endalert %}

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

If you spawn a function that returns a value, make sure the spawned function
has finished executing before using its returned value.  The same is true for
any state that may change as a side-effect of a spawned function.

{% alert "danger" %}

**Incorrect:**

```cilkc
cilk_scope {
  x = cilk_spawn p_fib(n-1);
  y = p_fib(n-2);
  return x + y;                     // value of x is indeterminate
}
```

{% endalert %}

{% alert "success" %}

**Correct:**

```cilkc
cilk_scope {
  x = cilk_spawn p_fib(n-1);
  y = p_fib(n-2);
}
return x + y;                       // value of x is p_fib(n-1)
```

{% endalert %}

On a related note, if you spawn a function that returns a value, be sure to
declare the variable which will receive the returned value before the
`cilk_scope` block that uses it.  Otherwise, that variable won't be defined
outside the `cilk_scope` block (which is where its value is assigned).

{% alert "danger" %}

**Incorrect:**

```cilkc
cilk_scope {
  int x = cilk_spawn p_fib(n-1);
  int y = p_fib(n-2);
}
return x + y;                       // x and y are not defined
```

This pitfall may seem benign as it would typically lead to a compilation error,
but note that it may introduce a subtle logical bug if the `cilk_scope` is
nested within another scope that also uses `x` and `y` identifiers.

{% endalert %}

{% alert "success" %}

**Correct:**

```cilkc
int x, y;
cilk_scope {
  x = cilk_spawn p_fib(n-1);
  y = p_fib(n-2);
}
return x + y;                     // x and y are defined
```

{% endalert %}

Be careful to ensure that pass-by-reference and pass-by-address arguments to a
spawned function do not expire within the function's `cilk_scope` block, or
else the function may outlive the arguments and attempt to use them after they
have been destroyed. (Note that this is an example of a {% defn "data race" %}
which would be caught by Cilksan.)

## Serializing your parallel program

If you remove the `cilk_spawn` and `cilk_scope` keywords from a correct Cilk
program, the result is a valid and correct serial program.  For example, if you
do this with the `p_fib()` function code above, you end up with the following
function, which we call `fib()`:

```cilkc#
int fib(int n) {
  if (n < 2)
    return n;
  int x, y;
  {
    x = fib(n-1);
    y = fib(n-2);
  }
  return x + y;
}
```

Function `fib()` is the {% defn "serial projection" %} of `p_fib()`, which
means it computes exactly the same result but without running any tasks
simultaneously.  So why bother with parallelism?  Because of the difference in
*how* `fib()` and `p_fib()` compute their (identical) results.  For many
computations, allowing tasks to run in parallel significantly reduces the
runtime.  We will see this in an upcoming tutorial, where we will analyze the
performance of `p_fib()` compared to `fib()`.
