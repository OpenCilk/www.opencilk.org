{% defn "parallel algorithms", "Parallel programming" %} involves writing instructions that can be executed on different processors simultaneously. Compared to serial programming, parallel programming offers opportunities to reduce the resources consumed (e.g., time, storage, energy, etc.), but taking advantage of these opportunities can be exceedingly complicated and error-prone &mdash; too much for developers to manage on their own. 

OpenCilk is a task-parallel platform: a layer of software that coordinates, schedules, and manages the multiple processors of a parallel program. OpenCilk automatically load-balances the tasks of the different processors and achieves performance that is provably close to optimal.

Using the OpenCilk platform, a developer writes code in Cilk, which extends C and C++ with a just few keywords to support task-parallel programming. Cilk supports {% defn "fork-join parallelism" %}, an especially simple form of task-parallelism that uses spawning and parallel loops. We'll introduce spawning here
and cover parallel loops in a later tutorial.

{% defn "Spawning" %} allows a function to be “forked,” or executed like a function call, except that the caller can continue to execute while the spawned function computes its result. For example, consider the fragment of C below. 
Spawning occurs in line 5, where the keyword `cilk_spawn` precedes the call to function `p_fib`.
With a spawn, the instance that executes the spawn&mdash;the parent&mdash;may continue to execute in parallel with the spawned function&mdash;its child&mdash;instead of waiting for the child to finish, as would happen in a serial execution.

```c#
int p_fib(int n)
{
  if (n < 2) return n;
  else {
    cilk_scope {
      int x = cilk_spawn p_fib(n-1);  // don't wait for function to return
      int y = p_fib(n-2);             // run in parallel with spawned function
    }                                 // wait for spawned function to finish
    return x + y;
  }
}
```

With Cilk, there are no tasks that *must* run in parallel; instead,
the programmer uses `cilk_spawn` to specify those which *may* run in parallel.
Every time a task-parallel program is executed, the OpenCilk runtime system uses this information to load-balance the tasks on the available processors.

The keyword `cilk_scope` complements `cilk_spawn` by defining a boundary that limits the extent to which tasks may run in parallel.
Whenever the program execution leaves a block of code delimited by `cilk_scope{...}` , it must wait as necessary for all spawned functions within the block to finish before proceeding.

If you remove `cilk_spawn` and `cilk_scope` from this example program, the result is a traditional serial program.

```c#
int fib(int n)
{
  if (n < 2) return n;
  else {
    int x = fib(n-1);
    int y = fib(n-2);
    return x + y;
  }
}
```

Function `fib` is the {% defn "serial projection" %} of `p_fib`,
which means they compute exactly the same thing.
So why bother with parallelism?
Because of the differences in *how* `fib` and `p_fib` compute their (identical) results.
For many computations, allowing tasks to run in parallel significantly reduces the resources required (e.g., time, storage, energy).
We will see this in a subsequent tutorial, when we analyze the performance of `p_fib` compared to `fib`.
