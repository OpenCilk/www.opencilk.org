## OpenCilk makes it easy
* to write fast parallel code for shared-memory multicores,
* to analyze and benchmark the parallel scalability of your program, and
* to detect and debug races or prove that your program execution is race-free.

## Use your machine's resources efficiently
[OpenCilk](https://opencilk.org) provides an ideal environment for developing fast code for applications that run on commodity and cloud multicore computers. It features a simple language, small codebase, and mathematically provable guarantees of good performance.

## Cutting-edge technology that's easy for students to learn

[OpenCilk](https://opencilk.org) is an open-source software development infrastructure for task-parallel programming that allows for substantial code reuse and easy exploration of design choices in language abstraction, compilation strategy, runtime mechanism, and productivity tool development. 


## Measure parallelism and maximize scalability with automated benchmarking
With [CilkScale](https://www.opencilk.org/doc/users-guide/cilkscale/) you can ensure that your program scales up and down to make the most of any host system.

## Optimize your code with a compiler that KNOWS parallelism
OpenCilk augments the "middle end" of LLVM to represent parallel control flow and bring every LLVM optimization to bear on your parallelized code.
