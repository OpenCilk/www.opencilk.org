  # Writing fast code

  Many people know how to write code, but few know how to write code that runs efficiently. You might use algorithms to achieve efficiency, but there's a lot more to software performance engineering (SPE) than that!

  [Speedcode](https://speedcode.org) is an online platform where you learn SPE by practicing. With nothing to install, you can jump right in and start practicing SPE skills with dozens of example programming problems. Each problem is already solved by some initial code, and you are challenged to make it run faster. The problems are curated to exemplify important SPE skills, and everything runs in a environment that supports reliable performance measurements and parallel programming with [OpenCilk](https://opencilk.org).
