# Writing fast code is easy with C/C++ and OpenCilk.

OpenCilk is an open-source platform that makes parallel programming a simple extension of serial programming.
 - Efficient compiling makes your OpenCilk program faster.
 - Provably efficient scheduling tunes each execution of your OpenCilk program to its host environment.
 - Provable race-detection guarantees that your OpenCilk program has a deterministic result.
