<p>OpenCilk is an open-source platform that makes parallel programming a simple extension of serial programming.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Efficient compiling makes your OpenCilk program faster.</li>
  <li>Provably efficient scheduling tunes each execution of your OpenCilk program to its host environment.</li>
  <li>Provable race-detection guarantees that your OpenCilk program has a deterministic result.</li>
 </ul>
