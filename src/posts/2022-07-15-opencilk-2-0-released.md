OpenCilk 2.0 is now available.  See the [Install](/doc/users-guide/install) page for instructions on how to download and install.

## Major changes

OpenCilk 2.0 features the following major changes from OpenCilk 1.1:
- **[Beta feature]** Cilk reducer hyperobjects (a.k.a., reducers) are now supported through a new language syntax and implementation.  A local or global variable in C or C++ can be made into a reducer by adding `cilk_reducer(I,R)` to its type, where `I` and `R` designate the identity and reduce functions for the reducer.  You can find documentation on the new reducer syntax [here](/doc/reference/reducers), but as a simple example, here is how a simple integer-summation reducer can be implemented using the new reducer syntax:
```c
#include <cilk/cilk.h>

void zero(void *v) {
  *(int *)v = 0;
}

void plus(void *l, void *r) {
  *(int *)l += *(int *)r;
}

int foo(int *A, int n) {
  int cilk_reducer(zero, plus) sum = 0;
  cilk_for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    sum += A[i];
  return sum;
}
```
- The compiler has been upgraded to be based on LLVM 14.0.6.
- Support has been improved and optimized for pedigrees and built-in deterministic parallel random-number generation. In particular, pedigrees are now correctly updated at both spawns and syncs.
- Support for pedigrees has been streamlined.  To enable pedigree support, simply link the Cilk program with the pedigree library, `-lopencilk-pedigrees`.
- Many bug fixes and performance improvements have been included compared to the previous version.

## Known limitations
- Reducers must be global variables and local variables.  In particular, OpenCilk 2.0 does not support reducers as struct or class members or as heap-allocated objects.  See the [Reducer documentation](/doc/reference/reducers) for details.
- Support for the Intel Cilk Plus reducer library has been removed.
- With the compiler now based on LLVM 14, the default DWARF version is now DWARFv5.  If you encounter an error when using a tool such as `unhandled dwarf2 abbrev form code 0x25`, then the tool does not support DWARFv5.  You can opt back into using the old DWARF version by passing either `-gdwarf-4` or `-fdebug-default-version=4` to `clang` when you compile the program.
- The default setting of floating-point contraction is now `-ffp-contract=on`.  As a result, floating-point computation may behave differently with this version of OpenCilk.  You can opt back into the old floating-point-contraction behavior by passing the compiler flag `-ffp-contract=off`.  See [here](https://releases.llvm.org/14.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#floating-point-support-in-clang) for more details.
- There are some standard library functions and LLVM intrinsic functions that Cilksan does not recognize.  When Cilksan fails to recognize such a function, it may produce a link-time error of the form, `undefined reference to '__csan_FUNC'` for some function name `__csan_FUNC`.
  - Please report these missing functions as issues on the [OpenCilk issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenCilk/opencilk-project/issues).
  - **[Beta feature]** You can work around this issue by passing the additional flag ``-mllvm -cilksan-bc-path=`find /path/to/opencilk/ -name "libcilksan*.bc"` `` when compiling the Cilk program.  (Note that `/path/to/opencilk/` should *not* be the path to the `clang` executable, but is instead the path to the whole OpenCilk installation, such as `/opt/opencilk/`.)
